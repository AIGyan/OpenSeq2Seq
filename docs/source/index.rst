OpenSeq2Seq
===========

Welcome to OpenSeq2Seq toolkit! The goal of this project is to greatly simplify
workflow with sequence-to-sequence models in TensorFlow.

To start using this toolkit, look at the
:ref:`installation instructions <installation-instructions>` and then
see the :ref:`getting started <getting-started>` page.
If you are already familiar with the basics and have
everything set up, you can find some useful information in the
:ref:`adding new models <extending>` section or in the :ref:`API documentation <api-docs>`.
