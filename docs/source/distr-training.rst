Distributed training
====================

This section will contain information about how to run different models in
multi-GPU mode (config change) and in Horovod mode (config change + new command
to run script). Can also contain some general guidelines for what seems to be
faster in which cases (e.g. depending on the number of GPUs or input-output
modality).
